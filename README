# aws-msad-terraform

A proof of concept of deploying a highly available, scalable Microsoft Active Directory infrastructure in AWS using AWS Directory Services.

AWS Directory Services provides the Active Directory in multiple subnets in different availability zones to achieve high availability. After the AD is deployed, we can only interact with it through a Windows machine (I call it "AD Writer") that has joined the domain.

In this proof of concept, Terraform is used to orchestrate the deployment of the Active Directory and the AD Writer machine.
